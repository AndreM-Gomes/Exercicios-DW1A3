        brie, is a large breed of dog traditionally used as a herder and guardian of sheep.</p>
    <h2>Breed History</h2>
    <p>The briard, which is believed to have originated in France, has been bred for centuries to
        herd and to protect sheep. The breed was used by the French Army as sentries, messengers and
        to search for wounded soldiers because of its fine sense of hearing. Briardswere used in the
        First World War almost to the point of extinction. Currently the population of briardsis
        slowly recovering. Charlemagne, Napoleon, Thomas Jefferson and Lafayette all owned briards.
